For calling the String Data type in scanner class: if we use another data type before
string data type the computer will not wait to enter string value in the console.
If we want to make the computer wait for our String data type value we should write
the scanner.nextline(); twice.
String fullName=scanner.nextline();
Or we can create two full Scanner class. scanner s1 = new scanner(system.in)
                                          Scanner s2 = new Scanner(system.in)

switch case: it is faster then if else if statement. because with if statement
the computer check all the condition one by one but with switch case the computer
directly check the condition which is true.
Note: we can not use logical operator or relational operator with switch case.
also we can not use double, long and boolean data type.
switch case only check for equality.
