Methods:
    Are blocks of code which have names, and they
    contain java code. We can call these methods
    to execute all the code inside them.
Why should we use methods:
    They help us avoid code duplication in multiple
    classes. If we need to run a piece of code again
    and again in multiple classes, we can simply create
    a method and can reuse it in all the classes.
Types of methods:
    static method
    instance methods.
static methods:
    We call these methods by just writing the name of
    the class. They cannot use instance variables.
 instance methods:
    Require us to create an object of the class.
Interview Question:
    Can we use instance variables in static methods?
    No, we can't do this because instance variables must be initialized
    first before we can start using them. Instance variables belong to
    object and static belongs to class.
Types of variables:

1: We can use access modifier with constructor.
2: we can not use static with constructor.
3: when we import a class it means we are using another class inside our class to a void code reputation.
4: why we want to static variable public? because we want to share the method with others.
